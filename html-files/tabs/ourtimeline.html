    <h2>June 2023</h2>
    <p> Things to write about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Honestly really scared for this month, I didn't want things to fizzle out. With my overthinking headass I 
            didn't know if we were going to keep those feelings for each other, but thank god for snapchat because 
            I loved watching your videos (even though I would be late to watching them at times) you were just so 
            expressive and that's why I am thankful for snap because we got to be expressive and allow each other 
            to see our reations and keep up with one anothers lives without needing to read it through a text, which
            didn't show emotion</li>
        <li>She told me that she missed me</li>
        <li>I attempted to make the most out of it, I came up with virtual date ideas (watching a movie, obviously
            it didn't work: show a picture of the list) </li>

    <h2>July 2023</h2> 
    <p> Things to write about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You watched the mexico vs panama game :)</li>
        <li>She came back to Holland!!! This was exciting but very nerve wracking for me, cause it had been 2 months
            since we'd last seen each other, and I didn't know how it was going to go, I didn't want to mess anything up
            I think you could tell I was nervous as hell </li>
        <li>It was amazing though, I absolutly loved every second of it, and we got over our shyness</li>
        <li>I was really happy that you were able to go on our spantaneous triple minigolf date, and that you were able 
            to play games with us after</li>
        <li>A detail that I love from this day is that we originally left to drop you off, parked outside your friends house
            stayed in the car, then fucking dipped back to my house ahahahaha</li>
        <li>From here we just talked, then you wrestled me for my phone BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE THE DAMN TIK TOK, and
            then all the sudden it happend you kissed me (07-24-2023). I was quite shocked for a moment then locked back in 
            to get my phone but I'm honstly glad it happened that way cause it prevented the akwardness of it </li>
        <li>From that day we made the most of very opportunity we had to see each other, I know you are gonna say 
            "dOn'T aPoloGiuze" but I did feel bad cause we would stay up very late, but I loved every second of it</li>
        <li>WE FINALLT GOT A PICTURE TOGETHER!!</li>
        <li>We slow danced</li>
        <li>But as all things do, I knew it was gonna end so I wanted to do something speically which was the painting
            date idea, with the shitty ass acrylic paint, that we surpisingly made work, and we produced some high level
            art something that of 1800s victorian era</li>
        <li>But of course I couldn't get enough of you, so an attempt to see you one last time, I made a horrible banana
            bread that I am greatfull that I didn't give to cause I honstly think could've made you sick</li>

    <h2>August 2023</h2>
    <p> Things to write about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>YOUR BIRTHDAY WAS COMING UP!!! I did so much research on what I should I get you but I was just blanking and 
            freaking out, I even followed a dance mom on tik tok because she had a couple of videos in which she 
            would talk about things that her daughter using for dance, but again I was overthinking so I said fuck
            that cause I didn't know if that would apply to you</li>
        <li>Ultimentaly I went with the sweater idea, and was so worried that I would mess it up so I but it off, till
            the week that you go here lmao, when you had called me to see what I was doing so that we could see each other
            I was literally in the middle of sowing the sweater but I couldn't tell you so I said "uhhhh something..."</li>
        <li>When I met up with you and your mom, it was hilarious because your mom kinda teased you and you kinda got embrassed
            ahahaha and then we walked around but you didn't let me hold your hand cause you were on stike :| but I got
            away with it ;) and then Kailoni reminded me of moment that is the bain of my exisitance :|</li>
        <li>Then you're surpise birthday party happened which was also a surpirse to me because I wasn't expecting you to
            be there, even though it was your birthday party ahaha</li>
        <li>Then we watched la la land, and you got to open your gift, which I was really nervous about, but when you opened
            it I was glad that you liked, an intresting thing part of that gift is it was supposed to me like a matching sweater
            what we both would wear (which is why there is two) and so I was gonna add a heart and the date in which we 
            started dating on my right sleeve and your left seleev but then I was like "no then that kinda takes away your 
            gift since I am getting one too" so I ultimently sraped it and was maybe I'll make it again for like valintes or 
            anervisary</li>

    <p> Things to write about:</p>

        <li>But with that an important moment happened in which we told each other "I love you", and holy fuck was that
            hard for me to say because as you know I can't express what I am feeling and so it took me minute, and the thing
            with that is I knew I loved you way before that, but one I wanted to do it in person, and I wanted to wait for the 
            right moment to tell you</li>
